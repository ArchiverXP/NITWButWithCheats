# NITWButWithCheats

To build:

Just follow https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/dev_guide/plugin_tutorial/1_setup.html and you're golden.
Put LEGIT NITW dlls (I used the Weird Autumn version from itch.io but you don't have to use itch.io's release) into the libs folder

(Non Weird Autumn releases were NOT tested)
